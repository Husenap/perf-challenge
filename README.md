# TGA Performance Challenge - 2017

##### Overview
You will be required to implement a solution to determine if a file contains duplicates of registration numbers.

* The file is guaranteed to exist, and contains one registration number per line
* The format of the registration numbers is 'AAA999'
* Sample data is in the range of 64k to 32Mb, expect to be evaluated against large file sizes
* The goal is to determine the presence of duplicates as quickly as possible

#### Input parameters
Your implementation will receive a const std::string& filename as input.

#### Return value
Your implementation will return a bool, indicating if the file contained duplicates

#### Setup
In order to complete setup for this repository
* Clone or download this repository (https://github.com/johron/perf-challenge)
* In the perf-challenge-app/src/participants folder, duplicate the `reference_user` folder and rename it to `firstname_lastname` (using your own name).
* open the files `Implementation.h/.cpp` and rename the namespace from `reference_user` to `firstname_lastname` like above. These have to match.
* Run the following command in the project folder to generate the solution files     
 * Ensure you have CMake 3.1 or later installed
 * `c:\dev\perf-challenge> cmake . -B.build`
 * Solution files are generated in the .build folder

#### Remember
* Set perf-challenge-app to the startup project
* Set your working directory to the perf-challenge-app folder (where the data folder can be found)
* If everything has been setup correctly, you should be able to run the code and see the reference user attempt to solve the problem.

#### Failing criteria
* Your implementation does not compile
* Your implementation crashes runtime
